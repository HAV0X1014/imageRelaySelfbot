# imageRelaySelfbot
A small python program to relay discord image URLs to a webhook using a user listener account. This was intended to be used with relaying images from fanart reposting channels, but can also be used as a HTTP link and file upload relayer.

The info it includes is the server the relayed file is from and the username of the image sender. It supports sending to multiple webhooks, and listening to multiple servers and channels.

It will relay any links, as well as any uploaded files to the webhook(s) of your choice.
